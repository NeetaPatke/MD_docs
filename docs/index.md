# Hi there!

Great! This is my first Markdown page that is published in HTML.

Yes, you are right. Jekyll helped me convert it to HTML.

I just want to add an image here. Don't know how. Let's look up!

Yeee, what I did was:
1) Created an issue.
2) Dragged the required image in the issue window.
3) In the edit mode, copied the MD code that GitHub had generated for inserting an image.
4) Pasted the code in this document.

Thanks, GitHub!
